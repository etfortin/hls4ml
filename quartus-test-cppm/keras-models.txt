# Synthax:
#    MODEL_NAME[:WEIGHTS_FILE] [f:FPGAPART] [c:CLOCK_PERIOD] [r:REUSE_FACTOR] [t:PRECISION]
# where
#    MODEL_NAME - Name of the file containing json model (without ".json")
#    WEIGHTS_FILE - Name of the HDF5 file containing model weights (without ".h5")
#    f:FPGAPART - Xilinx part number to use
#    c:CLOCK_PERIOD - Clock period
#    r:REUSE_FACTOR - Reuse factor
#    io:s - User serial I/O, otherwise use parallel I/O
#    t:PRECISION - Default precision <Total Bits, Integer Bits, Signed(Optional)> ex: <16,6,1> or <16,6>
